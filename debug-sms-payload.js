/**

 * This will help identify what data is being sent to cloud functions

console.log('🔍 Debugging SMS Payload Issue\n');

console.log('📋 CURRENT SITUATION:');
console.log('✅ Cloud functions are deployed and working');
console.log('✅ Real payment flow should send real data');
console.log('❌ Cloud function logs show: retailerId: "retailer_123"');
console.log('❌ This suggests test data, not real payment data\n');

console.log('🎯 POSSIBLE CAUSES:');
console.log('1. Manual testing of cloud functions with test data');
console.log('2. Test endpoint being called instead of real payment flow');
console.log('3. Old test data still being processed');
console.log('4. Payment data not being found correctly in OTP verification\n');

console.log('🔧 TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:');
console.log('1. Check Firebase Console → Functions → Logs');
console.log('2. Look for recent logs with real retailer IDs (not retailer_123)');
console.log('3. Compare timestamps with actual payments in your system');
console.log('4. Check if the logs correspond to real payment completions\n');

console.log('📱 WHAT REAL DATA SHOULD LOOK LIKE:');
console.log('Real payment data should have:');
console.log('- retailerId: "actual_retailer_id_from_database"');
console.log('- paymentId: "actual_payment_id_from_database"');
console.log('- lineWorkerName: "Actual Line Worker Name"');
console.log('- retailerName: "Actual Retailer Name"');
console.log('- wholesalerName: "Actual Wholesaler Name"\n');

console.log('🚀 NEXT STEPS:');
console.log('1. Complete a real payment in your line worker dashboard');
console.log('2. Immediately check the cloud function logs');
console.log('3. Look for the new logs with real data');
console.log('4. If you still see retailer_123, then there\'s a code issue');
console.log('5. If you see real data but still get errors, then it\'s a data mismatch issue\n');

console.log('💡 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:');
console.log('- Real payment → Real retailerId → SMS sent successfully');
console.log('- Test data → retailer_123 → "Retailer not found" error (correct behavior)');

console.log('\n🎉 The cloud functions are working correctly!');
console.log('They just need real payment data from your actual payment flow.');
