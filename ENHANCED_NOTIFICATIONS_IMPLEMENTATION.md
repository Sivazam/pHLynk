  - Cross-device synchronization
  - Background support

### 2. **Updated Dashboard Components**

#### SuperAdminDashboard
- ✅ Integrated enhanced notification service
- ✅ Added notification read/unread handlers
- ✅ Proper bell icon count updates
- ✅ Role-based initialization ('SUPER_ADMIN', 'system')

#### LineWorkerDashboard  
- ✅ Integrated enhanced notification service
- ✅ Added notification read/unread handlers
- ✅ FCM for high-value payments (> ₹5,000)
- ✅ Test notification buttons added
- ✅ Role-based initialization ('LINE_WORKER', tenantId)

#### RetailerDashboard
- ✅ Integrated enhanced notification service
- ✅ Added notification read/unread handlers
- ✅ Enhanced OTP notifications with FCM
- ✅ Test notification functionality
- ✅ Role-based initialization ('RETAILER', tenantId)

### 3. **Enhanced DashboardNavigation**
- ✅ Added notification click handlers
- ✅ "Mark all as read" functionality
- ✅ Visual indicators for unread notifications (blue dot)
- ✅ Improved notification dropdown with scroll
- ✅ Real-time count updates

### 4. **FCM Integration**
- ✅ High-value payment notifications (> ₹5,000)
- ✅ OTP notifications with enhanced delivery
- ✅ Role-based FCM targeting
- ✅ Fallback to in-app if FCM fails

### 5. **Real-time Notification Service Updates**
- ✅ Enhanced Super Admin payment handler with FCM
- ✅ Enhanced Line Worker payment handler with FCM
- ✅ Automatic FCM for critical events

## 🔧 Key Features

### **Smart Notification Delivery**
```typescript
// In-app notifications for all events
enhancedNotificationService.addNotification({...});

// FCM only for critical events
if (amount > 5000 || type === 'otp' || type === 'warning') {
  await roleBasedNotificationService.sendNotificationToRole({...});
}
```

### **Role-Based Targeting**
- **Super Admin**: System-wide events, high-value payments across all tenants
- **Wholesaler**: Tenant-level events, line worker performance
- **Line Worker**: Personal achievements, high-value collections
- **Retailer**: OTP alerts, payment confirmations

### **Bell Icon Features**
- ✅ Real-time count updates
- ✅ Visual indicator for unread notifications (blue dot)
- ✅ "Mark all as read" button
- ✅ Click to mark individual notifications as read
- ✅ Scrollable notification list

## 🧪 Testing Features

### **Test Buttons in LineWorkerDashboard**
1. **Test Basic**: Tests both in-app and FCM notifications
2. **Test High-Value**: Simulates high-value payment notification (> ₹5,000)
3. **Test OTP**: Simulates OTP notification with FCM

### **Test Functions Available**
```typescript
// Test basic notification
await enhancedNotificationService.testNotification();

// Test high-value payment (includes FCM)
await enhancedNotificationService.testHighValuePayment();

// Test OTP notification (includes FCM)
await enhancedNotificationService.testOTPNotification();
```

## 📊 Notification Flow

```
1. Event Occurs (Payment, OTP, etc.)
       ↓
2. EnhancedNotificationService.process()
       ↓
3. Add to in-app notifications (always)
       ↓
4. Check if critical event?
   ├─ Yes → Send via FCM/PWA
   └─ No → In-app only
       ↓
5. Update all connected clients
       ↓
6. Bell icon count updates
       ↓
7. User can mark as read
```

## 🎯 Critical Event Triggers

### **FCM Sent For:**
- ✅ OTP notifications (all amounts)
- ✅ High-value payments (> ₹5,000)
- ✅ System warnings
- ✅ Payment failures

### **In-App Only:**
- ✅ Regular payments (< ₹5,000)
- ✅ Milestone achievements
- ✅ Assignment changes
- ✅ General updates

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing notification service continues to work
- ✅ No breaking changes to current APIs
- ✅ Gradual adoption possible
- ✅ Fallback to in-app if FCM unavailable

## 📱 Mobile PWA Support

- ✅ Background notifications via FCM
- ✅ Vibration for critical notifications
- ✅ Sound alerts (where supported)
- ✅ Proper mobile notification display

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- ✅ Duplicate notification prevention
- ✅ Efficient state management
- ✅ Lazy loading of FCM service
- ✅ Minimal re-renders with useCallback

## 📈 Monitoring & Debugging

### **Console Logs**
- 🔔 Notification initialization logs
- 📱 FCM delivery status
- 🧪 Test results
- ⚠️ Error handling with fallbacks

### **Visual Indicators**
- 🔵 Blue dot for unread notifications
- 🔢 Real-time count updates
- ✅ Success/error feedback in tests

## 🎉 Benefits Achieved

1. **Unified System**: Single service for all notification types
2. **Background Support**: Critical notifications work when app is closed
3. **Cross-Device Sync**: Notifications follow users across devices
4. **Smart Delivery**: FCM only for important events prevents spam
5. **Role-Based Intelligence**: Proper targeting based on user roles
6. **Enhanced UX**: Visual indicators, mark as read functionality
7. **Testing Support**: Easy testing of all notification types

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
