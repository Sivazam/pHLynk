        question: 'What is a Super Admin?',
        answer: 'Super Admin has system-wide access and can create wholesaler accounts, monitor all system activity, manage system configuration, and view system-wide analytics. This role is typically for system administrators and IT managers.'
      },

    faqs: [
      {
        question: 'How are payments processed in PharmaLync?',
        answer: 'Payments are processed through a secure workflow: Line Workers initiate payment collection for outstanding amounts, the system generates a 6-digit OTP, the OTP is sent to the retailer, the retailer enters the OTP to verify the payment, and once verified, the payment is recorded and all parties are notified.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What payment methods are supported?',
        answer: 'PharmaLync primarily supports cash payments collected by line workers, with OTP verification for security. The system is designed to integrate with various payment methods including UPI, bank transfers, and digital wallets based on business requirements.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How are invoices created and managed?',
        answer: 'Wholesaler Admins create invoices with medicine details, quantities, and amounts. Invoices have status tracking (OPEN, PARTIAL, PAID, CANCELLED) and the system automatically calculates outstanding amounts based on invoices and payments.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I make partial payments?',
        answer: 'Yes, PharmaLync supports partial payments. Line Workers can enter custom payment amounts (partial or full payments), and the system automatically updates the invoice status and outstanding balances accordingly.'

      {
        question: 'Do I need internet connection to use PharmaLync?',
