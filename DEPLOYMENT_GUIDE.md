# üöÄ PWA Notification System Deployment Guide

## üìã Overview
This guide will help you deploy the complete PWA notification system using **Database Triggers (Option 1)** + **FCM Integration (Option 3)**.

## üîß Prerequisites
- Firebase project with Firestore
- Firebase Functions CLI installed
- Node.js and npm installed
- FCM configuration already set up

## üìÅ Files to Deploy

### 1. Database Triggers (`cloud-functions-database-triggers.js`)
This file contains the Firestore triggers that will automatically send notifications when:
- New payments are created (sends OTP)
- Payments are updated (sends completion/failed notifications)
- New invoices are created (sends invoice notifications)

### 2. Updated FCM Registration
Your existing FCM registration has been enhanced to support multiple user types.

### 3. Enhanced Role-Based Notification Service
Updated to automatically register device tokens for push notifications.

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Database Triggers

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your Firebase project directory
cd your-firebase-project

# 2. Copy the database triggers file
cp /path/to/cloud-functions-database-triggers.js functions/index.js

# 3. Install dependencies
cd functions
npm install firebase-admin

# 4. Deploy the functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Step 2: Update Firestore Security Rules

Add these rules to your Firestore database to allow the functions to work:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Payments collection
    match /Payments/{paymentId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // FCM tokens collection
    match /fcmTokens/{tokenId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Retailers collection
    match /Retailers/{retailerId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Users collection
    match /Users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are set in your Firebase Functions:

```bash
# In your functions/.env file
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=pharmalynkk
FCM_SERVER_KEY=your_fcm_server_key
```

### Step 4: Test the System

1. **Deploy your updated Next.js app** with the enhanced notification service
2. **Visit**: `http://your-domain.com/test-notifications`
3. **Test notification permissions** and device registration
4. **Create a test payment** in your Firestore database
5. **Check if notifications are received**

## üì± Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Browser Notifications
- [ ] Permission granted
- [ ] Direct notifications work
- [ ] Service worker notifications work

### ‚úÖ FCM Integration
- [ ] Device token registered
- [ ] Background notifications work
- [ ] App closed notifications work

### ‚úÖ Database Triggers
- [ ] Payment creation triggers OTP
- [ ] Payment update triggers completion
- [ ] Invoice creation triggers notification

## üîç Debugging

### Check Cloud Function Logs
```bash
firebase functions:log
```

### Check FCM Registration
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.getItem('user')
localStorage.getItem('retailerId')
```

### Test Database Triggers
Create a test payment in Firestore:
```javascript
// In Firebase Console or Firestore SDK
{
  retailerId: "test-retailer-id",
  lineWorkerId: "test-worker-id",
  amount: 100,
  state: "PENDING",
  requiresOTP: true,
  otp: "123456",
  createdAt: new Date()
}
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### When Payment is Created:
1. Database trigger fires
2. OTP notification sent to retailer via FCM
3. Line worker gets payment initiated notification

### When Payment is Completed:
1. Database trigger fires
2. Completion notification sent to retailer and line worker
3. Real-time updates in app

### When App is Closed:
1. FCM delivers notification to device
2. Service worker shows notification
3. User can tap to open app

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue: No FCM Tokens
**Solution**: Ensure users grant notification permission and device token is registered

### Issue: Functions Not Triggering
**Solution**: Check Firestore security rules and function deployment

### Issue: Notifications Not Received
**Solution**: Check device notification settings and FCM configuration

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Review Firebase function logs
3. Test with the `/test-notifications` page
4. Verify Firestore database structure

## üéâ Success Indicators

‚úÖ Users receive OTP notifications when payments are created  
‚úÖ Users receive completion notifications when payments are completed  
‚úÖ Notifications work when app is closed (background)  
‚úÖ All user types (retailer, line worker, wholesaler) receive relevant notifications  
‚úÖ Cloud Functions show request counts in Firebase Console  

You're all set! Your PWA notification system should now work automatically with database triggers.
